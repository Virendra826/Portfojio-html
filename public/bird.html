<h2>🐦 Bird – The Feathered Flyer</h2>
<ol><li>Birds have hollow bones that make them light enough to fly in the sky.</li>
    <li>Not all birds can fly — penguins swim and ostriches run fast instead!</li>
    <li>They use their beaks instead of teeth to eat, peck, and build nests</li>
    <li>Parrots are clever birds — some can talk and copy human voices!</li>
    <li>Birds lay eggs and keep them warm until baby chicks hatch. 🐣</li></ol>
