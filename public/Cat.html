<h2>🐱 Cat – The Curious Explorer</h2>
<ol><li>Cats can jump up to 6 times their body length in one leap!</li>
    <li>Their whiskers help them feel spaces — like built-in sensors.</li>
    <li>They sleep for 12–16 hours a day to save energy for pouncing.</li>
    <li>Cats purr when they’re happy, but also to calm themselves.</li>
    <li>Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats — they were treated like royalty! 😺👑</li></ol>
