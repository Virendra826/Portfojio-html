<h2>🐰 Rabbit – The Fluffy Hopper</h2>
<ol><li>Rabbits have teeth that never stop growing — they chew all the time!</li>
    <li>They hop with powerful back legs made for jumping and running fast.</li>
    <li>A rabbit’s ears help them hear from far away and cool their body.</li>
    <li>They love to dig tunnels called burrows to live and hide in.</li>
    <li>Baby rabbits are called kits, and they are super tiny and cute! 🐇💕</li></ol>
